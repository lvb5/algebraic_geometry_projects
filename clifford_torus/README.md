# Exploring the Clifford Torus

We explore the properties of the Clifford Torus and, more specifically, find a way to visualize the torus, which lives in R^4, in R^3 via stereographic projection. We then demonstrate a method for computationally finding the closest point on the Torus to an arbitrary point. Code for this method in `Julia` is included. An animation of the torus implemented in `Python` is also included. Finally, a summary of our exploration is included in a `.pdf`. `TeX` code for the creation of the `.pdf` is also included.
