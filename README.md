# Computational Algebriac Geometry Projects

The following repo contains projects completed in MATH 555, Computational Algebriac Geometry at Lawrence University during the Fall 2021 term. All projects are completed using the `Julia` programming language for numerical computation, `Python` for some plotting and visualization, and `Sage` for symbolic computation. Each folder has a `.pdf` with a summary and explaination of the research completed. Additionally, each file has a README with more specific information for each project. 

## Projects

1. Exploring the Clifford Torus
2. Implementing the Newton-Ralphson Method for solving equations and systems of multivariable equations.
